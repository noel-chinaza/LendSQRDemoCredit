#Demo Credit is a mobile lending app that requires wallet functionality. This is needed as borrowers need a wallet to receive the loans they have been granted and also send the money for repayments.


You are required to build an MPV wallet service where:

A user can create an account
A user can fund their account
A user can transfer funds to another userâ€™s account
A user can withdraw funds from their account.

This project utilizes and implements a traditional accounting system. The cardinal rule of double-entry accounting is that "for every debit entry, there must be a corresponding credit entry" which means "everything must balance out to zero", and that rule is applied to every transaction written to the system

The system is organized into layers that are only responsible for the intended functionality in a way that leaves the system upgradable

the structure includes:

- /prisma
    |
    |- /dbml: generated graph of the systems database design
    |- /seed: responsible for initializing the database for first time setup by creating the necessary system profiles and system accounts
    |- schema.prisma: the modelling file that handles the database design and migrations    
- /server 
    |- /config: holds configurations for system variables
    |- /domain
    |    |- /classes: holds class abstractions for models that make system operations simple and easy to read
    |    |- /payment_gateways: holds implementations for various payment channels(PAYSTACK & FLUTTERWAVE in this case study) used by users to deposit money into their accounts which are upgradable and easily maintainable
    |    |- /withdrawal_gateways: holds implementations for various withderawal channels (CRYPTO & BANK in this case study) used by users to remove money from their profiles in the system
    |- bin.ts: main entry point for the express server powering the application
